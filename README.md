**Part 1: Building and Training a CNN Model for Face Expression Recognition**

1. **Imports and Setup:**
   - Imports necessary libraries: `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `seaborn`, `os`, and Keras components for deep learning.
   - Defines image size and data path. 

2. **Displaying Sample Images:**
   - Loads and displays sample images of a specific expression (e.g., 'disgust') from the training dataset using `matplotlib`.

3. **Preparing Training and Validation Data:**
   - Uses `ImageDataGenerator` for data augmentation and creates training and validation data generators from the dataset.
   - The dataset is split into 7 classes and is ready for model training.

4. **Building the CNN Model:**
   - Defines a Sequential CNN model with multiple convolutional layers, batch normalization, activation (ReLU), max-pooling, and dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
   - Adds fully connected (dense) layers followed by batch normalization, activation, and dropout layers.
   - Compiles the model using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.

5. **Training the Model:**
   - Sets up callbacks for model checkpointing, early stopping, and reducing learning rate on plateau.
   - Trains the model using the training set and validates it on the validation set. Training is monitored for accuracy and loss, with early stopping based on validation loss.

6. **Plotting Training Results:**
   - Plots the training and validation accuracy and loss over epochs to visualize model performance.

**Part 2: Real-Time Emotion Detection**

1. **Imports and Setup:**
   - Imports necessary libraries: `cv2` for OpenCV operations, `numpy`, and Keras components for loading the pre-trained model.

2. **Loading Pre-trained Model:**
   - Loads the pre-trained emotion classification model and the Haar Cascade face detector.

3. **Real-Time Emotion Detection:**
   - Captures video from the webcam.
   - Converts the frames to grayscale and detects faces using the Haar Cascade classifier.
   - For each detected face, the region of interest (ROI) is resized to 48x48 pixels, normalized, and fed into the pre-trained model to predict the emotion.
   - The detected emotion label is displayed on the video frame.
   - The video feed continues until the user presses 'q' to quit.

**Key Steps in Each Part:**

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Displaying images from the dataset.
   - Creating data generators for training and validation.

2. **Model Building:**
   - Defining a deep CNN architecture.
   - Compiling and summarizing the model.

3. **Training:**
   - Using callbacks for saving the best model, early stopping, and adjusting learning rates.
   - Training and validating the model over multiple epochs.

4. **Visualization:**
   - Plotting accuracy and loss curves.

5. **Real-Time Detection:**
   - Loading the trained model.
   - Detecting faces and predicting emotions in real-time using the webcam.
